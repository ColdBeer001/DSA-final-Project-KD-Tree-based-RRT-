# DSA-final-Project-KD-Tree-based-RRT-
This is a KD Tree based RRT* algorithm, which is the DSA final project of Lingyi and Songjun.

The main program is called My3DCodeKDTree.m 
Please run it.

The RRT* related code is in this file and the "max_ite" in line 21 is the maximum iterations, currently I set as 5000.

Where the files:
"intersec.m"
"colli_check.m"
are used to check collision.

where the other files are all used to implement KD Tree.
